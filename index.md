# The world in the eyes of DES.

You are writing your notes, and suddenly you receive a notification. A harmless one, at its look-maybe, it's something you already made plans of, or it's one of those where you didn't expect something to happen. But life isn't always like that, and the strokes of randomness keep its eyes open for all of us. And this time, it was me.

A DES. The acronym by which I define a `DEGREE EXTENDED STUDENT.` It's funny to know how a designation can impact your life. And that is what I'm here to talk about—the world in the eyes of a symphony, the breadth and width of melancholy.

It's not different. Imagine yourself waking up for your job or even your class. You open it to see your google calendar if there's an invitation you are preparing for. There are notifications on your phone that remind you of your deadlines. You wish to take a break sometimes and do too—a weekend near your favorite restaurant or a coffee with your friends. Life is good. Yet there is one thing that doesn't bother you but visits you like an old friend—asking some questions which feel challenging to answer. But terrifyingly easy to understand.

The freedom of being a DES lies in its shame. A shame bestowed upon you as darkness by people and unacceptable by norms, but inside of which hides a candle of flame—glowing slightly, visible over time with power. A power that you may not necessarily find but will feel.

And if you find it, _burn yourself_.

Burn your **designations**, your **identity**, your **recognition**, your **status**, **obligations**, **ego**, and every other name you made for yourself, thinking it's who you are.

_Because it's not._

_You are not your idea._

And then, life feels funny.

When I became, politely say `A DES,` instead of being burdened by the series of failures that came after. I did feel freedom. Freedom of not being expected. A release of being shadowed. And the true nature of my power takes over by what you don't know about me. Of what you could never expect.

And that gives me space—a space to explore a world of possibilities and ask a series of questions. Look for the only things that matter. Like my sweetheart sitting in front of me or the book that lies on my computer. The silence of my efforts talking to me. The voices in my head, singing to me. And to live my life, to what it is, indeed.

This letter is a note not just to anyone reading this but a reminder to realize who I am. And that's not bounded by the things I do or the names I take. But the life around me, and the moment that's right in front of your eyes.
