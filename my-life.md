# The world in the eyes of DES.

You are writing your own notes, and suddenly you receive a notification. A harmless one, at it's look. Maybe it's something you already made plans of, or it's one of those where you didn't expect something to happen. But life isn't always like that, and the strokes of randomness keeps it's eyes open for all of us. And this time, it was me.

A DES. The acronym by which I define a `DEGREE EXTENDED STUDENT`. It's funny to know how a designation can have an impact on your life. And that is what I'm here to talk about. The world in the eyes of a symphony, the breath and width of melancholy.

It's not really different actually. Imagine yourself, waking up for your job, or even you class. You open to see your google calender if there's an invitation you are preparing for. There are notifications in your phone that remind you of your deadlines. You wish to take a break sometimes, and do to. A weekend near your favourite restaurant or a coffee with your friends. Life is good. Yet there is one thing, which doesn't bother you as such, but visits you like an old friend. Asking some questions which feel difficult to answer. But terrifyingly easy to understand.

The freedom, of being an DES, lies in it's shame. A shame that's bestowed upon you as a darkness by people and unacceptable by norms, but inside of which hides a candle of flame. Glowing slightly, visible over time with power. A power which you may not necessarily find, but will definitely feel.

And if you find it, _burn yourself_.

Burn your **designations**, your **identity**, your **recognition**, your **status**, **obligations**, **ego** and every other name that you made for yourself thinking it's who you are.

_Because it's not._

_You are not your idea._

And then, life feels funny.

When I became, to politely say `A DES`, instead of being burdened by the series of failures that came after. I did feel a freedom. A freedom of not being expected. A freedom of being shadowed. And the true nature of my power takes over by what you don't know about me. Of what you could never expect.

And that gives me space. A space to explore a world of possibilities, ask a series of question. Look for the only things that matter. Like my sweetheart sitting in front of me, or the book that lies on my computer. The silence of my efforts talking to me. The voices in my head, singing to me. And to live my life, to what it is, truly.

This letter is a note not just to anyone reading this, but a remainder to realize who I am. And that's not bounded by the things I do or names I take. But the life that exists around me, and the moment that's right infront of your eyes.
